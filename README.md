This repository will contain the hands-on project works I have done for the coursework: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Below is the objective Context on the projects:

1) FoodHub :
   
     The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company improve its business.

2)  Personal Loan Campaign:
   
    To predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans, to understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and to identify which segment of customers to target more.

3) Easy Visa :
    
    In FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year.
    
    The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. OFLC has hired the firm EasyVisa for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist at EasyVisa have to analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model:
    
    Facilitate the process of visa approvals.
    Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.
